\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{chap:evaluation}

In this chapter, we explore the performance of SDS in practice.  We show
microbenchmarks for access and mutate flows in both Gaia and Syndicate, and we
show how our sample applications perform.  Our systems are not particularly
optimized in any way, and yet performance is comparable to using the underlying
cloud storage and CDNs directly.  This suggests that with more optimized
systems, using SDS as a distributed system design principle will incur low overhead.
