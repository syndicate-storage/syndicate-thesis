\section{Intruduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The world's increasing reliance on Web applications raises questions of data ownership and
governance.  This is because Web applications are global, borderless entities that host
sensitive data for many users in many jurisdictions.  However, conventional
Web applications place all user data under the control of the
application operator, whereby the operator's infrastructure hosts
all authoritative user-specific application state.  This thesis proposes an alternative 
organizing principle for Web applications where the user hosts their own state with the storage
infrastructure of their choice, and allows the application to access it on the
user's terms.

Computer software is valuable because it gives users a way to interact with
data.  This is especially true for Web applications.
At the very least, Web applications host enough information to authenticate
users.  Most popular Web applications offer the ability to host other
user-submitted or user-generated information like pictures or messages.

Since Web applications are multi-user systems, a key function they provide is
to mediate user/data interaction on a per-user basis.  In particular, most applications
create a notion of ``ownership'' or
``control'' for users over their data.  For example, a social network gives users the abstraction
of photo albums and conversation threads, and an online game gives users the
abstraction of avatars and in-game items.

Regardless of what notions of ``ownership''
are presented, the application always hosts the \textit{de
facto} authoritative state of the data.  This is a consequence of the fact that
the application's business logic mediates all interactions, and runs on the application operator's
infrastructure.  In order to use the application, the user effectively cedes it all
control over the authoritative copy of their data and blindly trusts the application to
process it in good faith.

We believe that this is a harmful arrangement for both users and applications,
in the following ways:

\noindent{\bf False Ownership}.  Even though the application gives
the user a notion of ``ownership'' or
``control'' over their data, these notions are provided at the
\textit{application}'s discression.  Not only are user expectations mismatched
with the reality of the application's operation, but also the user's quality of
life can be severly, negatively impacted when the application fails to
meet this expectation.  For example, the application can remove a feature the
user depends on, break its API without warning, or accidentally lose data.

\noindent{\bf Blind Trust}.  In addition, the user places
absolute trust in the application's ability to keep the
data secure.  That is, the user trusts the application to ensure that the \textit{only}
possible interactions allowed on their data are precisely those that the user
allows.  Even ignoring the UI/UX issues that would arise when allowing users to
configure exactly what these interactions are, making any such guarantees is extremely
difficult in practice.  Hacks and breaches are all too common.

\noindent{\bf Lock-in}.  A third problem for users is that this arrangement
facilitates application lock-in.
This arrangement makes no provision for a bulk data export API, so a user
extracting their data is as tedious as trying to read each individual piece
through the application's user interface.  In addition,
applications compete for users, and a straightforward way to discourage
competitors is to make it easy for users to join an application but hard to
migrate their data out.  This only adds further discouragement from building
a bulk data export API.

\noindent{\bf Silent Migration}.  Even when users manage to export their data, they do not regain the same control
over it as they had before uploading it to the application.  The application
still has copies, and other users may inadvertantly
continue to treat the old application as the authoritative source for the user's
data.  Many applications' terms of service reserve their right to do this.

\noindent{\bf Re-inventing Storage}.  At the same time, conventional Web
application design hurts application developers and operators.
It hurts developers because the application must always take 
responsibility for keeping the data available and durable, even though this is
not its primary business function.  This makes the code
more complex, and makes it harder to reason about the application's correctness.
Indeed, one of the key selling points of the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)
paradigm is the ability for many developers to offload their
applications' storage implementations to a third party, in order to have faster
development schedules and less code (even though this may increase the
application's total cost of ownership in the long run).

\noindent{\bf No Room for Error}.  Requiring applications to host user data also poses operational challenges, even
if the application code is production-quality.  Application operators must keep the
application's physical infrastructure running and in
good working order, as well as monitor the running application for misbehavior and keep
its software packages up-to-date with security patches.  Moreover,
operators have very little room for error--a single data breach or major outage
can harm millions of users, sometimes irreparably.


\subsection{Related Work}

These observations are not new.  The fundamental problem with
conventional application design is that the code and infrastructure 
are both the single point of interaction with data and the single point of
failure in the system.  Worse, the centralized nature of the design
means that failures can have arbitrarily bad consequences for
arbitrary numbers of users.

This is a well-known problem with many prior and ongoing proposed solutions.
